<h3>DEFINITION</h3>
<p>There is no universally accepted definition of a 'small arm' or of a 'light weapon'. 
The Small Arms Survey largely adopts the proposal put forward by the 1997 UN Panel 
of Governmental Expert (available on www.un.org) which considers portability a defining characteristic. 
The Panel’s list includes both civilian, private, and military weapons that fire a projectile with the 
condition that the unit or system may be carried by an individual, a small number of people, or transported 
by a pack animal or a light vehicle. The Panel’s list is organized into 'small arms' and 'light weapons':
</p>
<br>


<p>small arms: revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, 
sub-machine guns and light machine guns.</p><br>
<p>light weapons: heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, 
portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-tank 
missile and rocket systems; portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS); and mortars of 
calibres of less than 100 mm.</p>
